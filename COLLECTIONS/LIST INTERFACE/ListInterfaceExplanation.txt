The List Interface in Java extends the Collection Interface and we can organize and manage the data sequentially.

Key Features:

Maintained the order of elements in which they are added.
Allows duplicate elements.
The implementation classes of the List interface are ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, and Vector.
It can add Null values that depend on the implementation.
The List interface offers methods to access elements by their index and includes the listIterator() method, which returns a ListIterator.
Using ListIterator, we can traverse the list in both forward and backward directions.
